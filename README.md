# Om Chitlangia  
Founder — Main Research (Sole Proprietorship)

Quantitative systems for financial markets.

## Snapshot

- 3+ derivatives pricing implementations (Binomial, Monte Carlo, BSM)
- Volatility surface modeling across moneyness × maturity grids
- Numerical convergence testing & error structure analysis
- Alternative data feature engineering for credit modeling
- Production deployment experience (Vercel / Netlify + SSL + DNS)

## What I Actually Build

**Volatility Modeling Framework**
- Implied volatility extraction
- Surface behavior diagnostics
- Error mapping by strike & maturity
- Stability testing across parameter shifts

**Alternative Data Credit Model**
- Feature pipeline design
- Statistical testing
- Model validation & residual analysis

**Financial Systems**
- Python-based forecasting engines
- Structured research environments
- Deployment-ready SaaS architecture foundations

## Technical Base

**Core**
Python · SQL · Git · Linux

**Quant Stack**
NumPy · Pandas · SciPy · Statsmodels · scikit-learn

**Infra**
AWS (in progress) · Docker (in progress) · DNS/SSL configuration

## Operating Principles

- Explicit assumptions
- Measurable outputs
- Controlled model behavior
- No ornamental complexity

---

## Current Direction

Building Main Research into a structured quantitative lab focused on:

- Volatility modeling
- Market structure inefficiencies
- Systematic financial tooling
